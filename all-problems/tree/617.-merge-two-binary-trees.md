# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

### Description

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

### **Note:**

The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
    if (root1 == null || root2 == null) {
        return root1 == null ? root2 : root1;
    }
    
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(root1.val + root2.val);
    
    root.left = mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left);
    root.right = mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right);
    
    return root;
}
```
{% endtab %}

        return t2
    }
    if t2 == nil {
        return t1
    }
    
    t1.Val = t1.Val + t2.Val
    
    t1.Left = mergeTrees(t1.Left, t2.Left)
    t1.Right = mergeTrees(t1.Right, t2.Right)
    return t1
}
```
