# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

### Description

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

* `1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess \(i.e. `pick < num`\).
* `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess \(i.e. `pick > num`\).
* `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess \(i.e. `pick == num`\).

Return _the number that I picked_.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2

```

### **Constraints**

* `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`

### Solution

{% tab title="Go" %}
```go
func guessNumber(n int) int {
    left, right := 1, n
    for left < right{
        mid := left + (right - left) / 2
        val := guess(mid)
        if val == 0 {
            return mid
        } else if val == 1 {
            left = mid + 1
        } else {
            right = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return left
}
```
